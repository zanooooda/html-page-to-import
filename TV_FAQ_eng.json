		"question": "The color spreads when you lie down and watch it.",
		"answer": "Symptoms of occurrence The screen may look dark depending on the location (angle) you are watching. The cause of color blur due to the viewing angle is that LCD / LED products block light using liquid crystal, and since the liquid crystal itself does not emit light, color blur and darkening symptoms may occur depending on the angle of watching TV. Also, liquid crystals are divided into two types according to their purpose. The PVA panel, which is mainly used for TVs, has an excellent side viewing angle compared to the TN panel, so you can watch it from the side with a similar image quality to the front. However, due to the panel characteristics, it is not 100% the same as watching from the front. The liquid crystal is divided into a PVA panel for TV and a TN panel for monitor. The TN panel, which is mainly used for monitors, has good light transmittance when viewing the front, enabling clear image quality, but the image quality is much lower than the front when watching the top, bottom, left, and right sides. Since it is a panel mainly used for monitors, the front viewing characteristics are good, but the image quality is poor due to the panel characteristics when viewing the side. Due to the characteristics of the side viewing angle, you can feel the symptoms of color blur and darkening when lying down and watching the side, and please refer to this as a symptom caused by the characteristics of the TN panel, not the abnormality of the product."

And can I connect earphones or headsets to the rear terminal by wire? It's called audio minijack, but doesn't regular stereojack have an output terminal? Answers Hello. Sir/ma'am. I am the person in charge of Samsung Electronics service cyber center. Please understand that the UN50F6900AF model you inquired about does not support Bluetooth headsets and cannot be connected to wireless headsets. The UN50F6900AF model does not support earphone terminals (stereo jacks) and only has voice output terminals. The voice output terminal is a terminal that only outputs the sound from the TV as it is, and when the earphone is connected, the sound is output to the TV and also to the earphone. The voice output terminal cannot adjust the volume, and in the case of the earphone jack terminal, is the sound muted so that the sound cannot be output to the TV speaker? , the voice output terminal is not muted, so audio output is performed together with the TV and the earphone connected to the voice output terminal. In other words, if the volume of the TV is reduced after connecting the earphone to the voice output terminal, the TV speaker does not make a sound, and the earphone terminal outputs audio, but the size of the output audio volume cannot be adjusted.

		"question": "Please let me know about TV USB microphone connection",
		"answer": "Question content UN50H6430AF is being used. It is not equipped with a wireless LAN, so I am using a Samsung genuine wireless LAN plugged into USB. Not long ago, there was a Geumyoung karaoke app on the smart hub, so it was beneficial and good to run it, so I bought a USB microphone (KSM-508) through Geumyoung Shopping Mall, plugged it into USB, and used it, and it came out about 0.5 seconds late when the microphone voice was output to the speaker. There are a total of 3 USB terminals on the TV, and it's the same even if you plug them in. As a result of the inquiry to Geumyoung, I exchanged it for the same other product, but it's the same. Geumyoung says there is no problem because they test and go out. If the same symptoms appear with the new product, it may be a TV problem, so please contact the manufacturer. The microphone standard is frequency response: 60hz to 15khz impedance: 600 omega+-3 at 1khz. I don't know if it's professional, but please let me know if the speed of outputting the microphone as sound after responding to the TV is slow or the microphone itself is a problem. Answers In the case of USB microphones, voice delay inevitably occurs in the process of converting digital signals into analog signals, and Geumyoung Mimi Noraebang uses AUX to enter the outside input of TV, so there is no symptom of delayed voice. Please note that it is a characteristic part of the Geumyoung karaoke device. Among the products of Geumyoung Noraebang, you need to use Geumyoung Mini Emp, an external device. It's a pity that you're using a USB microphone, but it's hard to improve. Please understand that it is a hardware SPEC."

		"question": "I'm curious about Q &amp; A related to terrestrial UHD broadcasting quality.",
		"answer": "Usage guide \u25a0 Target model (all UHD TV models)   - 2017 UHD TV (UHD TV in 2017 supports American ATSC\n 3.0)  - UHD TV before 2016 (UHD TV before 2016 supports European DVB-T2) \u2192 For UHD TVs before 2016, you need to purchase a UHD kit to watch the broadcast.   \u25a0 UHD broadcasting quality Q &amp; A Q1. It's UHD, but why is the picture quality bad? A1. UHD should be produced with UHD cameras, editors, microphones, and storage devices from the time of production, but so far, UHD contents have not been produced much due to the lack of UHD equipment. Therefore, since most of the contents of the existing FHD are changed to UHD image quality and transmitted, the image quality is not much different from that of the FHD. In addition, there are not many brokerage houses equipped with UHD transmission equipment at broadcasting stations, so the image quality is set low and transmitted to establish a stable reception environment. To see UHD quality, please see content made exclusively for UHD. (There is a UHD-only channel on TV plus ) Q2. Why should I use STB (or UHD KIT) to watch terrestrial UHD? A2. In the case of products before 2016, it was possible to receive DVB-T2, a European method, and around June 2016, ATSC\n 3.0 UHD was adopted as a standard method in Korea and the main broadcast of terrestrial UHD began in May 2017. Please purchase STB (or UHD KIT) for products before 2016. Q3. When can I see the right UHD content? A3. In consultation with each other, the government and broadcasting stations were scheduled to conduct 5% of all broadcasts as UHD content in 2017, and plan to gradually increase it to 25% in 2020 and 100% in 2028."

		"question": "It's clicking.",
		"answer": "Expected cause It is a noise caused by applying a relay switch to prevent unnecessary power loss. Method of action As power efficiency increases worldwide, relay switches are applied among power terminal parts to prevent unnecessary power loss. When the power is turned on, the relay switch contacts and normal power is supplied to the TV. The relay switch connects and generates click noise. Relay switch contact drops when power is turned off and power is cut off before it is supplied to the TV. At this time, the relay switch contact falls and click noise is generated. In other words, click noise is generated when the relay switch is operated during power ON / OFF, which is not a problem with the product, but a specification of the product to prevent unnecessary power loss."

		"question": "The stand's tilting.",
		"answer": "[Stand left and right deviation specification standard] The stand is assembled separately, not integral with the TV, so there is a slight tolerance between the TV and the stand connection. This tolerance causes symptoms that appear to be tilted to one side even if normal installation is carried out, and the larger the inch, the worse the symptoms that appear to be tilted may look. The scope of Samsung Electronics' management of left and right deviations with normal specifications is as follows, and if it is within the specifications below, please refer to it as a symptom caused by tolerance, not product abnormalities.

		"question": "It only works in front of the TV.",
		"answer": "Expected cause It may occur due to insufficient battery capacity of the remote control or more than the remote control. Method of action Remote control battery replacement description Most of the symptoms that the remote control does not work are caused by the lack of remaining battery capacity of the remote control. The battery of the remote control provided at the time of purchase is naturally discharged in the distribution process, so it is difficult to use it as much as expected, and the remote control battery must be replaced with a new one. For products sold as low-cost bundled products, the usage time is much shorter than that of genuine batteries, so it is recommended to use genuine batteries packaged in pairs. Battery polarity confirmation explanation When replacing the remote control battery, the battery polarity may be wrong and the remote control may not work. You need to connect the battery - pole to an area that protrudes like a battery insertion spring. If the battery + pole is connected to a spring-like protruding area, the remote control does not work. [Battery normal connection (+) polarity] [Battery normal connection (-) polarity] A new pair of battery replacement explanations When replacing the remote control battery, it may occur when using it by replacing the battery used by other products, not by replacing it in pairs. Unlike the old remote control in the past, the remote control of the recently sold model is equipped with smart functions and has high power consumption, so even batteries that operated normally in other products may not operate normally on TV. When replacing the remote control battery, you must replace the pair together. [Remocon battery-like pair] [Remocon battery different pair] [Note] The remote control genuine battery is charged at\n 3.2 V and sold, and in the case of the TV remote control, if the battery voltage drops below 2 V, the remote control does not work. Remote controls for products other than TVs operate below 2 V, but in the case of Samsung remote controls, smart functions are applied and operate only under conditions above 2 V, so other products If you replace the battery you used, the remote control will not work if it is less than 2 V, so you must replace the pair together when replacing the remote control battery. Explaining the Causes of Three-wavelength Fluorescent Lamps If the fluorescent light in the home is turned off and the TV remote control is operated, the frequency of the three-wavelength fluorescent light may invade the TV remote control frequency area and cause frequency confusion. The three-wavelength fluorescent lamp uses an electronic safety device exclusively instead of a coiled magnetic stabilizer, and electromagnetic waves generated from the stabilizer may cause frequency interference at the TV remote control receiver, causing symptoms of not receiving the remote control. [Method of Action] As a temporary measure, there are ways to turn off and use fluorescent lights facing the TV, and to replace fluorescent lights with regular fluorescent lights rather than three-wavelength lights. Please contact the nearest lighting company to replace the fluorescent light. In 1997, the National Institute of Technology and Quality standardized the electronic stabilizer KS C8100 for fluorescent lamps, and the electronic stabilizer frequency for fluorescent lamps is stipulated to use bands other than 33 kHz to 40 kHz. \n \u203b It is caused by the frequency of the three-wavelength fluorescent lamp invading the frequency 38 kHz area of the TV remote control."

In the past, analog TVs did not require much time to process data by watching low-definition images, so they could be changed quickly when changing channels, but since broadcasting itself has a lot of data when watching high-definition digital broadcasting, synchronization time of about 1 to 2 seconds is required when changing channels, resulting in symptoms that take a long time to change channels. Please note that this is caused by an increase in data throughput while watching high-definition digital broadcasting, not product failure, and is used as a common symptom of all digital TVs around the world. It may take a long time to change the channel even when using STB (set-top box). If the sudden channel change is delayed, you need to check if the set-top is being updated regardless of the TV.

		"question": "The sound of all the channels suddenly went down.",
		"answer": "Reason for revision of volume standard Revision of the volume standards for broadcasting programs following the revision of the Broadcasting Act; As of May 2, 2016, the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning has established standard volume standards for digital broadcasting programs and advertisements to ease viewer inconvenience caused by rapid changes in volume between and within channels. (Compliance with Article 70-2 (1) of the Broadcasting Act) Q &amp; A Q1. Did the sound suddenly turn down? A1. As the standard law for digital television broadcast volume is applied from May 2, it is normal that the sound becomes smaller than before. Q2. Is there any reason to set the volume standard lower than before? A2. Due to inequality caused by competition for sound levels between broadcasting channel users (home shopping, sports, dramas, etc.), there was a difference in volume between channels and programs in the channel, and the inconvenience was up to consumers. In order to solve this inconvenience, genre-specific characteristic channels such as music, movies, and sports are cases where the law has been revised, recognizing that volume management at the production stage is necessary. (\n \u203b If professional music programs such as classical music and Korean traditional music are provided live, volume standards are not applied) Q3. Is there a standard value for volume level? A3. It is difficult to guide the standard value of the volume level. The standard volume prescribed by the relevant law is -24LKFS, and the tolerance is \u00b12 dB. .(\n \u203b LKFS is a standard unit of volume value calculated in consideration of human auditory cognitive characteristics) Q4.

How can I know that the law has been revised even though consumers have not been notified? A5. It was announced through the following broadcast by broadcasting company. [Publicity text for viewers (TV subtitles)] With the implementation of related laws (Article 70-2 (1) of the Broadcasting Act) to resolve the volume imbalance between broadcasting channels and programs, digital TV broadcasting programs of all broadcasting media (terrestrial waves, cables, satellites, etc.) will be broadcast in compliance with the standard volume from 4 a.m. on May 2, 2016.

		"question": "What is MHL?",
		"answer": "MHL function guide           What is MHL?  It is a function that connects the micro USB terminal of the mobile device and the HDMI terminal of the TV to show the screen of the mobile device as it is on the screen of the TV. In addition, mobile phones can be charged through TV, and mobile phones can be controlled through TV remote control.    How can I see MHL?  You must have a mobile device and TV that supports MHL, and you can watch it by connecting an MHL-only cable or an MHL dongle (HDTV adapter).    Does Samsung TV support all ports?  When using MHL-only cable, MHL is supported only for HDMI\n 3.    What kind of TV model can be supported?  It is a model of LED 7 series or higher and PDP 8 series in 11 years.    What kind of mobile device model can be supported?  Compatibility verification has been completed for the Galaxy S2 model, and for other MHL-supported mobile devices, please contact the device manufacturer.    I am the buyer of the existing 11-year TV 7000. How can I do MHL?  If you download the latest SW from the Samsung website and upgrade it, you can use MHL.    How do I connect to MHL?    1) When using MHL-only cable: See Figure 1 on the right - One side of the MHL cable is connected to the micro USB terminal of the mobile device, and the other side is connected to the HDMI3 of the TV.  2) When using MHL dongle (HDTV adapter): See Figure 2 on the right - After connecting the power of the MHL dongle, one side of the MHL dongle connects to the micro USB terminal of the mobile device and the HDMI terminal of the TV with the HDMI cable.     The screen does not appear when connecting the MHL-only cable.  Our TV supports MHL only for HDMI\n 3. Please check the input source. Also, please check if your phone supports MHL.    Where can I get an MHL cable or an MHL dongle (HDTV adapter)?  You can search online with an HDTV adapter or purchase it at Samsung Service Center.    Remote control does not work when using MHL dongle.  When using MHL dongle, operation by remote control is not required. Please contact the manufacturer or use the MHL cable.    KEY supported by TV is not running on mobile device.  The actual execution of the key supported by the TV depends on the mobile device. Please contact the manufacturer of the device.    The application of the mobile device does not work with the TV remote control.  The TV provides only movement and selection functions for application execution of the mobile device. Please contact the application manager or mobile device manufacturer to see if the actual application is executed.    Can I see it as a TV USB input through a micro USB cable?  You can't see it with the USB input of the TV, and please use the MHL cable or MHL dongle (HDTV adapter).    I can't charge it while using it.  Depending on the current consumption of the mobile device, charging may take a long time during use.    Can I charge it in TV stand by state?  Provides MHL charging function in standby state.    What is the resolution you support?  MHL can be supported up to 1920X1080 at 30Hz.    Can't I turn on the TV with my cell phone like Anynet+?  MHL does not support turning on TV with mobile device.    Compared with the cell phone, the picture quality is lower.  If the resolution of the one source is low, the TV screen may look worse than a mobile phone because of its large size. Or, if the image resolution sent from the mobile phone is low, the image quality may look bad. If you send it to 1080, the TV will show it as the cell phone sends it, so please contact the cell phone manufacturer for more information."

		"question": "What is the USB PVR function?",
		"answer": "Broadcasting recording function guide  \n 1.Is it possible to record ATV (analog) and external input signal? \u2192 Not possible. It can only be recorded on DTV, and when you press the \"record\" button on ATV, \"Timeshift and recording are only supported on digital broadcasting. The phrase \" appears and it doesn't work. \n 2. I want to record on DTV, but can I record if I can't receive the broadcast normally or can't see it? \u2192 \"Input signal is weak or not available so recording is not possible. The notice \" may appear and not work. \n 3. Can I switch to another channel (DTV / ATV) while recording? \u2192 Not possible. If you switch to another channel during recording (or reservation recording), \"Would you like to end recording and switch channels? [Yes] [No].\" Since it is not a 2TUNER method, it is impossible to watch other channels during recording. \n 4. Can I record even if I turn off the TV during recording (or reservation recording)? \u2192 It is possible. Even if the TV is turned off, recording is stopped, or if the recording completion time is not over, recording continues. However, recording is stopped if the power is cut off, not power OFF (power waiting). \n 5. Doesn't the phrase \"recording\" disappear in the upper left corner during recording? \u2192 Yes, the phrase keeps popping up to let you know that it is recording. It also moves little by little to protect the screen. In addition, recording for less than 10 seconds is not carried out during general recording, so \"records for less than 10 seconds are not stored. The phrase \" appears and the recording cannot be saved."

A device that can connect external devices separately is called One Connect. Existing method In the case of existing TVs, there was a terminal on the back of the TV that could connect external devices, so it was difficult to connect external devices when installed with wall hangers.

		"question": "Please let me know about HDR, HDR10, HDR+, HDR Dolby Vision",
		"answer": "Function guide HDR, HDR10, HDR+, HDR Dolby Vision Terminology HDR (High Dynamic Range) It is a technology that expands the range of brightness as close as possible to what humans see from the brightest to the darkest. HDR application can be seen in detail from very bright scenes to very dark scenes. For example, in dark cave scenes, HDR-applied TVs deliver not only the texture of cave walls but also their shapes and colors realistically. Every single sunshine is clearly shown in the scene where the yacht passes over the sea where the sun is shining. \u261e SDR (Standard Dynamic Range) - Standard degree of brightness difference (DR) between bright and dark parts (FHD application) \u261e HDR(High Dynamic Range) - The degree to which the brightness difference (DR) between the bright and dark parts is expanded to be close to what a person actually sees (UHD application) HDR type \u25a0 HDR+ It automatically provides optimal HDR effect for SDR or HDR images. It is a technology that analyzes the contrast of images in detail and shows images similar to those viewed by human eyes. \u25a0 HDR10 The HDR function of a product that satisfies the maximum brightness of 1,000nit, one of the specs related to brightness established by the UHD Alliance, is specifically called HDR10. \u25a0 HDR10+ If the brightness spec established by the UHA is satisfied, the image itself must be created with HDR10+ as a standard that can obtain premium UHD certification. It is an abbreviation of UHD Alliance and is a coalition formed by TV manufacturing technology companies, Hollywood studios, content distributors, and video technology companies. \u25b6 The difference between HDR10 and HDR10+ is in metadata. Metadata is data such as color and brightness information contained in content such as videos, games, and TV apps. HDR10 uses static metadata that applies the same color and brightness even if the scene changes. The quality of the image is bound to decrease in very dark or bright scenes, while HDR10+ is applied with dynamic metadata that automatically sets metadata for each scene, providing all scenes with optimized image quality. \n \u203b Metadata refers to additional image information in the content. This includes color, brightness information used in the HDR image mastering process. \u25a0 Dolby Vision This is the name of the image technology provided by Dolby. Dolby Vision embodies brightness, extended contrast ratio, vivid color, detail, and three-dimensionality through technologies similar to HDR that can express a wide color space."

Check the volume control method If the sound sounds strange while watching the broadcast through the set-top box, it may occur due to the difference in how to adjust the volume of the TV and the set-top box, and it can be easily adjusted. If the volume of the TV is set low (10 or less) or high, the voice level may be lowered and noise may be generated due to external influences.

		"question": "Your voice speed isn't right.",
		"answer": "Expected cause Since the processing speed of the video signal and the voice signal is different or the sound is heard through the home theater, a slight difference in the speed of the video/voice may occur. Method of action Explanation of the cause of the broadcast signal If symptoms that do not match the screen and voice speed occur, it may occur in some or all broadcast programs due to broadcast signals transmitted by broadcasting stations. Because the processing speed of the video signal and the voice signal is different, there is a slight difference in the speed of the video/voice, and although it is not usually felt, the speed difference may feel sensory depending on some broadcasting programs. It is not a symptom caused by a product abnormality, so please feel free to use it. Speaker delay time setting method When listening to TV voice through the home theater, the video is displayed directly on the TV screen, but since the voice signal is output from the TV through the home theater, some delay time occurs in the process of transmitting the voice from the TV to the home theater. Some of the functions of the TV can be set up by applying a function that can minimize the delay time. [Menu \u2192 Sound \u2192 SPDIF Settings \u2192 Delay Time Adjustment] If the voice is faster than the screen: Please set the delay time adjustment higher. [+] If the voice is slower than the screen: Please set the delay time adjustment lower. [-] Even if the delay time is adjusted, there is a time when voice is transmitted from the TV to the home theater, so symptoms that the screen / voice speed is not correct may occur. This is not a product problem, but a problem caused by the time the voice is transmitted from the TV to the home theater, so please refer to it when using it. Explain the cause of set-top box When watching a broadcast through a set-top box, the speed of video/voice may vary slightly depending on the speed of video/voice signal transmission from the set-top box to the TV. It doesn't usually feel big, but some broadcasting programs may feel the speed difference."

		"question": "Do you use RGB color filter for Samsung TV?",
		"answer": "Function guide RGB color filter - Color filter is a thin layer that represents various colors in LCD. - When the light from the LCD backlight passes through the color filter through the liquid crystal, it passes through the red (R), green (G), and blue (B) parts of the color filter, and the color of the light changes. - It is the same principle that when the flashlight light is shined on the cellophane, the light changes to various colors depending on the color of the cellophane. If there is no color filter, LCD will be expressed only bright and dark like black and white TV. - Most displays use a combination of red (R), green (G), and blue (B), which are the three primary colors of light, for each pixel to express various colors. - In the color filter layer, sub-pixels of R, G, and B are generally placed for each pixel, and these three colors represent more than millions of colors. - Samsung TV products use all model RGB color filters based on LCD and LED products. - RGBW is a specification with more white (W) filters, and among the products released by Samsung, RGBW type color filters were applied only to KN55S9CAF products in the past."

Internal management is based on the recommendations of the Medical Association related to thermal burns, so there is no harm to the human body in using the product.     Heat generation by product    Product name  Details      LED  - In the case of edge LEDs, LED BARs are located in certain areas of the top, bottom, left, and right due to their characteristics, so only certain areas can be hotter, and the product is slim and has high thermal conductivity, so it can feel hotter than other product groups. - You can see that the LED BAR, which is a light source, is installed in the hottest part by touching it with your hand.    LCD  - Back light is lamp, so heat is generated overall, and heat is generated most at the top of the front.    PDP  - Since the image is implemented by the gas discharge type plasma, invisible light is generated when the plasma collides, and heat is generated in the pixel in the process of generating visible light by hitting the phosphor."
